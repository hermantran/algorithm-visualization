  [Algorithm Visualizer](http://algorithm-visualizer.aws.af.cm/)
==================

### Project Topic and Goals
Algorithm Visualizer is a visualization and benchmarking tool of common sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript. The goal of this project is to work with D3.js for data visualization while also gaining a better understanding of sorting algorithms and their time complexities.

### Project Features
* Uses Node.js (Express) with Jade templating
* Uses AngularJS and RequireJS to organize the JS code structure
* Uses D3.js to generate visualization of the algorithms
* [Algorithms library](https://github.com/hermantran/js-algorithms) implemented with benchmarking support
